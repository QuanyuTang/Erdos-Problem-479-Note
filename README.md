# A Note on Erdős Problem #479

This repository contains an expository note on Erdős Problem #479 concerning the congruence

$$
2^n \equiv k \pmod n.
$$

For an integer $k$, define

$$
A(k) = \{\, n \ge 1 : 2^n \equiv k \pmod n \,\}.
$$

Graham conjectured that for every $k \neq 1$, the set $A(k)$ is infinite. This is listed as Problem #479 on Bloom’s Erdős Problems website.

## Known results

The following sets are known to be infinite:

- $A(0)$;
- $A(2)$;
- $A(-1)$ (Novák numbers);
- $A(-2)$.

For all other integers $k$, including many positive values such as $k=3,5,6$, the infinitude of $A(k)$ remains open.

## The case $k = 2^i$

Erdős and Graham attribute the statement that $A(2^i)$ is infinite for every $i \ge 1$ to an unpublished manuscript of Graham–Lehmer–Lehmer.  
However, no published proof appears to exist, nor does the manuscript appear in the bibliographies of Graham or D.~H.~Lehmer.


## Contribution of this note

This note serves two purposes:

- in Section 2 we survey the existing results and record those integers $k$ for which $A(k)$ is currently known to be infinite;
- and, for completeness, in Section 3 we give an explicit proof of the infinitude of $A(2^i)$, using multiplicative orders and Dirichlet’s theorem.
